NYCU Machine Learning (2022 Fall)

## HW1-Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
Implement logistic regression and linear regression by
using only NumPy, then train the implemented model using Gradient Descent by the
provided dataset and test the performance with testing data.

## HW2-Linear Discriminant Analysis
Implement Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant by
using only NumPy, then train your model on the provided dataset, and evaluate the
performance on testing data. 

## HW3-Decision Tree, AdaBoost and Random Forest
Implement the Decision Tree, AdaBoost and Random
Forest algorithm by using only NumPy, then train your implemented model by the provided
dataset and test the performance with testing data.

## HW4-Support Vector Machine
Implement the cross-validation and grid search
using only NumPy, then train the SVM model from scikit-learn on the provided
dataset and test the performance with testing data.

## HW5-Handwriting Recognition using DNN
Implement the deep neural network by any deep
learning framework, and train the DNN model on the
prepared dataset.
